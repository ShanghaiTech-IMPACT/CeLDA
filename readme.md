This repository contains the code and dataset for our paper "Cephalometric Landmark Detection across Ages with Prototypical Network" in MICCAI 2024.


Currently, we are still working on data anonymization. Once we have completed this process, we will publish the download link for our CephAdoAdu dataset and our source code at this repository.
